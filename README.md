## Should we only play the original track on repeat?

## Or have some rare chance to play a cover (like Weezer's cover)?

## Should we have pre-recorded little intermissions where Action Item narrates in a sultry voice and pretends to take a caller request? (spoiler: it's Africa again)

## Or do we play various permutations of the original track?
* africa at 1.25 speed
* africa pitch shifted up three semitones
* africa played through a narrow bandpass filter
* africa played in reverse
* africa, played in one second clips, reversed, in order
* africa with the beats flipped 1-2 and 3-4
